# My Portfolio Project 1 : Dashboard Development from an E commerce Dataset using Microsoft Power BI.
### Step 1 : EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis (I worked almost 3 hours on this step)
> In this step, The dataset was connected with Power BI using Direct Query, Dataset had 4 tables - Sales Table, Customer Table, Product Table, Territory (Location) Tables. The Columns in those relational tables needed a redo.

### Step 2 : Data Transformation (I worked almost 2 days on this step)
> All transformation were one using M language and DAX(Design analysis Expression)
Column transformation - Extract, combine, split to create dimensions/lookups. Textual transformation, Numnerical Tranformation - mainly to obtain Derived fields from the data which helps in further analysis using manily "Measures" in Power BI
Example of a Derived fields: from Total Revenue, finding the revenue brought in during previous 45 days - which can be analysed over range of products.


### Step 3 : Data Modelling 
> Establishment of relationships between the Lookup/Dimension tables and Master Fact table.

### Step 4 : Data Visualization (I worked almost 2 days on this step)
> All the data field obtained after rigorous transformation of the Data which is now represented on visuals. I got to learn use cases of some common graphs and also was able to learn common mistakes associated with them

### Step 5 : Formatting and Polishing
> Formatting the Data visualizations that are created in previous steps.

### Step 6 : ML algorithms on Numerical measures 
> Linear / logistic Regression for  forcasting let's say Revenue or Customer Growth etc.

### Step 7 : Establishing the User friendly experiance on the developed Dashboard using various tooltips, actions and Buttons.
> Using buttons and action and tooltips I was able to develop the dashboard truely interactive.
